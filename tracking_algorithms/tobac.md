# tobac 

The main elements of *tobac* are:

1. **Data input and output** - Xarray and pandas 
2. **Data filtering** - Gaussian smoothing and wave-length based filtering
3. **Feature detection** - works in 3D and with multiple thresholds
4. **Segmentation of cloud areas and volumes** - works in 3D and across different data sets (e.g. get the precipitation volume associated with detected clouds) 
5. **Trajectory linking** - uses propagation speed and works across periodic boundaries 
6. **Object-based analysis and visualization** - includes the identification of mergers and splitters in the track database


*tobac* developed with an open, multi-institutional international community, and has been built from the ground up in support of open science. Detailed documentation can be found [here](https://tobac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Any user feedback is welcome and users are invited to leave commentsand questions in the [GitHub discussion forum of *tobac*](https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac/discussions) or, if it concerns bug reports or specific user requests, a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac/issues). Release announcements, workshop and conference announcements, and other information of interest to the broader *tobac* users group are sent to the [tobac core group](https://groups.google.com/g/tobac/about) mailing list. If you are interested in contributing to the development of tobac, users are invited to join the [tobac developers](https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/tobac-developers) mailing list.
