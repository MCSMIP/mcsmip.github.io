title: "Mesoscale Convective Systems tracking Method Intercomparison (MCSMIP)"
---

Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are large complexes of convective clouds that stretch over at least hundred km horizontally and can last for several hours or even more than a day. Decades of research, field studies, and improvements in remote sensing technology, along with advanced modeling and theories, have helped us understand the structure, development, and effects of MCSs on weather and climate. MCSs are responsible for more than half of the rainfall in tropical regions and many midlatitude areas.

  <h1>What is the goal of MCSMIP?</h1>

  
  The Mesoscale Convective Systems tracking Method Intercomparison (MCSMIP) is a collaborative, international initiative that brings together researchers from universities, laboratories, and agencies around the world. Our mission is to deepen our understanding of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and their influence on global weather and climate, in particular how different tracking methods affect these conclusions. We do this by leveraging advanced satellite data and high-resolution model simulations.

To achieve this, we quantify the sensitivities and uncertainties that arise from using different tracking algorithms. By examining various tracking methods and criteria, we aim to better understand how different approaches affect key MCS characteristics, such as their lifetime, frequency, and size.
