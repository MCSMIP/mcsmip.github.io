*Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in global km-scale models are evaluated against satellite observations using eight ten feature trackers.
*Most models underestimate MCS precipitation amount and their contribution to total precipitation, with larger biases over ocean.
*Models overestimate MCS precipitation intensity and its sensitivity to precipitable water while underestimating stratiform rain contribution.
