# Tracking criteria

Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are defined using both a cloud shield identified in infrared brightness temperatures (Tb) and surface precipitation:

* Cloud shield area with Tb < 241 K must be at least 40,000 km$^2$ 247 and persists for at least
248 4 continuous hours, and must contain Tb < 225 K at least once during those hours.
* Must contain minimum peak precipitation of 10 mm h$^{-1}$ 249 inside the cloud shield for 4
250 continuous hours.
* Must reach a minimum rainfall volume of 20,000 km$^2^ mm h$^{-1}$ 251 (i.e., 100 km x 100 km
x 2 mm h$^{-1}$ 252 ) at least once during the lifetime.
